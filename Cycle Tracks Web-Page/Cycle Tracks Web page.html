                        It only takes two to four hours a week to achieve a 
                        general improvement to your health. Cycling is:
                        Low impact – it causes less strain and injuries
                         than most other forms of exercise.
                        A good muscle workout – cycling uses all of the 
                        major muscle groups as you pedal.
                        Easy – unlike some other sports, cycling does not require
                         high levels of physical skill. Most people know how to 
                          a bike and, once you learn, you don’t forget.
                        Good for strength and stamina – cycling increases stamina, 
                        strength and aerobic fitness.
                        As intense as you want – cycling can be done at very low intensity 
                        to begin with, if recovering from injury or illness, but can be built
                         up to a demanding physical workout.
                        A fun way to get fit – the adventure and buzz you get from coasting 
                        down hills and being outdoors means you are more likely to continue 
                        to cycle regularly, compared to other physical activities that keep you
                         indoors or require special times or places.
                        Time-efficient – as a mode of transport, cycling replaces sedentary 
                        (sitting) time spent driving motor vehicles or using trams, trains or buses 
                        with healthy exercise.

                        Cycling is mainly an aerobic activity, which means that your heart, blood vessels and lungs all get a workout. You will breathe deeper, perspire and experience increased body temperature, which will improve your overall fitness level.

                        It feels on the edge, nimble, hardcore if you will, 
                        and something I would have loved to race with a few years back.
                         It leaves you with no doubt that it will help you go that bit quicker. 
                         I can see why Team Ineos use this bike and have stayed with Pinarello 
                         over the last few years. It works, its fast and can be used on all but 
                         the time trial stages.

                        Out on the road it is capable, and with a relatively shallow wheel the
                         Pinarello F12 is useable both at the weekend and midweek. It feels robust
                          and I wouldn’t worry about it being delicate. The forks are something to 
                          consider, they feel like they have such a wide stance that jumping out of 
                          the saddle offers an odd sensation compared to more traditional shaped forks. 
                          A few rides in and it’s not as noticeable.
                        
                        That does come at a price though, and that is comfort. I dare 
                        say that there isn’t any comfort, despite wider tyres.
