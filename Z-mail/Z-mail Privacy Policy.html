            Privacy Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
    
        A privacy policy is a statement or a legal document (in privacy law) 
        that discloses some or all of the ways a party gathers, uses, discloses,
         and manages a customer or client's data. It fulfills a legal requirement 
         to protect a customer or client's privacy.
         The right to privacy is a highly developed area of law in Europe. All the member states of the European Union (EU) are also signatories of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). Article 8 of the ECHR provides a right to respect for one's "private and family life, his home and his correspondence", subject to certain restrictions. The European Court of Human Rights has given this article a very broad interpretation in its jurisprudence.

In 1980, in an effort to create a comprehensive data protection system throughout Europe, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) issued its "Recommendations of the Council Concerning Guidelines Governing the Protection of Privacy and Trans-Border Flows of Personal Data".[26] The seven principles governing the OECD’s recommendations for protection of personal data were:

Notice—data subjects should be given notice when their data is being collected;
Purpose—data should only be used for the purpose stated and not for any other purposes;
Consent—data should not be disclosed without the data subject’s consent;
Security—collected data should be kept secure from any potential abuses;
Disclosure—data subjects should be informed as to who is collecting their data;
Access—data subjects should be allowed to access their data and make corrections to any inaccurate data; and
Accountability—data subjects should have a method available to them to hold data collectors accountable 
for not following the above principles.[27]
The OECD guidelines, however, were nonbinding, and data privacy laws still varied widely across Europe. 
The US, while endorsing the OECD’s recommendations, did nothing to implement them within the United States.[27] 
However, all seven principles were incorporated into the EU Directive.[27]

In 1995, the EU adopted the Data Protection Directive, which regulates the processing of personal 
data within the EU. There were significant differences between the EU data protection and equivalent U.S. data privacy laws. These standards must be met not only by businesses operating in the EU but also by any organization that transfers personal information collected concerning a citizen of the EU. In 2001 the United States Department of Commerce worked to ensure legal compliance for US organizations under an opt-in Safe Harbor Program.[28] The FTC has approved a number of US providers to certify compliance with the US-EU Safe Harbor. Since 2010 Safe Harbor is criticised especially by German publicly appointed privacy protectors because the FTC’s will to assert the defined rules hadn’t been implemented in a proper even after revealing disharmonies.[29]

          Personal information can be anything 
         that can be used to identify an individual, not limited to the person's name, address,
          date of birth, marital status, contact information, ID issue, and expiry date,
           financial records, credit information, medical history, where one travels,
            and intentions to acquire goods and services.[1] In the case of a business it is often
             a statement that declares a party's policy on how it collects, stores, and releases personal
              information it collects. It informs the client what specific information is collected, and 
              whether it is kept confidential, shared with partners, or sold to other firms or enterprises.

              [2] Privacy policies typically represent a broader, more generalized treatment, as opposed
               to data use statements, which tend to be more detailed and specific.

        The exact contents of a certain privacy policy will depend upon the applicable law 
        and may need to address requirements across geographical boundaries and legal jurisdictions.
         Most countries have their own legislation and guidelines of who is covered, what information
          can be collected, and what it can be used for. 
          
          In general, data protection laws in Europe cover
           the private sector as well as the public sector. Their privacy laws apply not only to government 
           operations but also to private enterprises and commercial transactions.[3]
